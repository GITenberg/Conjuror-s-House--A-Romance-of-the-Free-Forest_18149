description: Set in the wild Canadian North, the adventure yarn centers upon a brave
  young trader who is one of the few to work independently from the monopolizing Hudson
  Bay Company. The young trader is looking for the man who killed his father after
  smearing his good name by claiming that his father slept with the wife of the owner
  of a trading post. The trouble for the young man begins when he is caught by Hudson
  Bay thugs and forced to make it through the wilds with neither food nor weapons.
  Somehow he barely manages to survive the harsh environment. Towards the end, the
  daughter of his father's killer shows up and helps save him. Later the trading post
  owner, who is just about to die, tells everyone the truth about the killing.
